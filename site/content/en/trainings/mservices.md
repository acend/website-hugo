In this training we go on a journey, we start with monolithic architectures and dive together into the world of MicroServices. With a hands-on-first approach, various approaches will be shown along with their opportunities, threats and also best practices. After the trip, terms like MicroServices, Event-Driven Architectures, Observability, Fault Tolerance, etc. are no longer unfamiliar words to us!

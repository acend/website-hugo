Prometheus is often used in the context of dynamic platforms in the container environment, such as Kubernetes and OpenShift, but is also suitable for monitoring classic environments. This two-day training in German or English offers a practical and clearly understandable introduction to Prometheus technology. The training is offered by acend in cooperation with Puzzle ITC. It can be conducted online or on-site."

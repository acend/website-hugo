main_text: "
Quarkus was created to enable Java developers to build applications for a modern, cloud-native world. Quarkus is a Kubernetes-native Java framework tailored for GraalVM and HotSpot, built from the best Java libraries and standards.\n\n 
In this training we will go through a complete development cycle together, starting with the bootstrapping of a Quarkus application and ending with its execution as a container. Always well accompanied by our experienced trainers and with a good mix of theory and hands-on labs."

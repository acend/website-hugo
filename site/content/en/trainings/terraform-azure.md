main_text: "
To manage its infrastructure declaratively as code, Terraform offers a wide range of functionality. The configuration files, which are typically stored in a Git repository, are used by Terraform as a single source of truth. These files are used, for example, to build infrastructure or to configure entire applications.\n\n

This one-day training in English or German offers a clearly understandable introduction to Terraform and a practical implementation part on Azure."

main_text: "GitOps is a natural extension of the Infrastructure-as-Code and Continuous Delivery principles with a focus on using Git as the single source of truth for your system. Changes to infrastructure and applications are made declaratively via a Git repository, with an automated process ensuring that the current state of your system reflects the state of the repository.\n\n
This one-day training in German or English offers a practical and clearly understandable introduction to GitOps using Argo CD on Kubernetes."

      text : "Through the training, we were able to deepen the know-how in the area of modern container technology in a practical way with the OpenShift platform provided. The very competent trainers were able to reduce the respect for the new container technologies and thus provide the training participants with a very good baseline for the future."

main_text: "
This two-day training course is aimed at IT professionals from the fields of system administration, architecture and software development who want to acquire a sound basic knowledge of Ansible.\n
Ansible is an open source tool for the automation, orchestration and general configuration and administration of computers. It combines software distribution, ad-hoc command execution and configuration management. The servers are managed via SSH, among other things, and no additional software is required on the system to be managed.\n
The Kickstart training provides an insight into the technology and uses hands-on labs to show how Ansible can be used efficiently.

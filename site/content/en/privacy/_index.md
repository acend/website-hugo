# General Terms

## Collection and Processing of Personal Data

We primarily process the personal data that we receive through our website or other applications or in the context of the business relationship with our customers and other business partners from these and other individuals involved.

We primarily collect personal data directly from you. In certain circumstances, we receive personal data about you from third parties. This information can fall into the following categories:
¬ Information from publicly available sources (e.g. media, Internet)      
¬ Information from public registries (e.g. trade register, debt collection register, land register)   
¬ Information in connection with regulatory and judicial procedures   
¬ Information relating to your professional functions and activities   
¬ Information about you in correspondence and meetings with third parties   
¬ Creditworthiness information (as far as we conduct personal business with you)   
¬ Information about you provided by people from your environment, so that we can conclude or handle contracts with you (e.g. references, your delivery address, authorizations, information on compliance with legal requirements, information from banks, insurances, sales and other contractual partners)    
¬ Information about you from the media and the Internet (as far as this is necessary in the specific case, e.g. in the context of a job application, press review, marketing, sales, etc.)   

¬ Data related to the use of the website (e.g. IP address, MAC address of the smartphone or computer, details of your device and settings, cookies, date and time of visit, pages and content accessed, features used, the website that directed you to our website, location information).

## Purposes of and Legal Bases of Data Processing

We process your information only for defined purposes and only in cases in which the law permits us to do so. In the following, you will find the individual data processing operations on our website as well as the purposes and legal bases for data processing.
The following reasons can serve as a legal basis:
¬ Your consent;
¬ The execution of a contract or precontractual measures;
¬ The fulfilment of legal provisions;
¬ Our legitimate interests as long as your interests and fundamental rights do not override ours;
¬ Safeguarding your vital interest or those of another individual or the execution of a task carried out in public interest;
¬ Other relevant legal bases.
You will find a reference to the relevant legal basis in the given act of data processing.
If you have given us permission to process your personal data for specific purposes, we process your personal data within the framework of and on the basis of this consent unless we do not have another legal basis for doing so. Consent can be withdrawn at any time, but this has no effect on data already processed.

## Data Transfer

In the context of providing our services as well as the website, we may have to rely on third-party services in certain circumstances. In this context, it is possible that we will charge a third party with the processing of personal information. In such a case, we ascertain by contract that this third party will fulfil the requirements of data protection. In certain circumstances, we might also be obliged to release your data to the authorities or other third parties.
We only pass on your personal data when you of the following conditions applies:
¬ You have given your consent;
¬ There is a legal obligation;
¬ It is necessary for the exercising of our rights, in particular for the execution of demands stemming from a contractual relationship;
¬ It is necessary for the fulfilment of the contract or the execution of pre-contractual measures;
¬ In case we have a legitimate interest in doing so and your opposing interests do not override ours;
¬ In cases in which there is another form of legal basis for the data transfer.
Under certain circumstances, your personal data may be passed on to companies abroad. These companies, however, are bound by the same data protection standards as us. In case the level of data protection in the country where the recipient company is based does not correspond to the level of data protection in Switzerland or the European Union, we will ensure by means of a contract that data protection standards equivalent to those of Switzerland or the European Union will be adhered to. This may be achieved by means of adopting standard data protection clauses of the European Commission or a supervising authority, an accredited and approved code of conduct in combination with binding and enforceable obligations on the side of the recipient or the accredited certification mechanisms in combination with binding and enforceable obligations on the side of the recipient.
In case of data being transmitted to a company based in the US, we will ensure that the company in question is certified according to the Swiss or the EU-US Privacy Shield agreement to ensure that the high level of data protection in Switzerland and the EU is guaranteed. If a certification is lacking, we will ascertain the necessary guarantees by contract.

## Retention Period

We only retain your personal data for as long as it is required in order to fulfil the purposes for which the data was collected in the first place.
We retain contractual data for a longer period of time as we are obliged to do so by law. Such retention obligations are dictated by the codes relating to mandatory reporting, financial reporting and tax law. According to these codes, business communications, finalized contracts and accounting records need to be kept for a period up to 10 years. Whenever we do not require such information for the provision of our services, this data will be blocked. In such a case, we only use the data for invoicing and tax-related purposes.


## Data Security

We take data security very seriously and take appropriate technical as well as organizational security measures in order to protect your personal data from accidental or intended manipulation, loss, destruction or unauthorized access by third parties. We continually improve our security measures in keeping with technological developments.
The SSL procedure (Secure Socket Layer) is used for the transmission of data on our website in connection with the highest encryption level of your browser. You can recognize that a page of our website is transmitted securely if the symbol of a closed lock appears in the status bar of your browser.

## Obligation to provide certain personal data

In certain circumstances, you might be obliged to provide personal data in order to enter into a business relation. This includes personal data necessary for the initiation and realization of a business relationship and the fulfilment of relevant contractual obligations. Without this data, we generally will be unable to enter into or execute a contract with you (or the entity or person you represent).
Also, the website cannot be used if certain data traffic security information (such as IP address) is not disclosed.

## Profiling

In part, the processing of your personal data will be automated with the aim to evaluate certain things about an individual (so-called profiling). In particular, we use profiling to provide you with targeted information and advice on products. For this purpose, we use evaluation tools that enable us to communicate with you and advertise as required, including market and opinion research.

## Your Rights

You have the right to request information about which of your personal data is retained. Additionally, you can demand the rectification of false data or request the deletion of personal data as long as regulations about the retention of data or a legal basis that allows for the processing of the data do not apply. Moreover, in certain circumstances you may have the right to restrict the processing of your personal data or object to your data being processed altogether. You have the additional right to receive the personal data concerning you which you have previously provided to us (the right to data portability). You have the right to receive the data in a common file format. We have already informed you about your right to revoke your consent above as well as in the relevant data processing operations.
We advise you that legal restrictions may impact the exercising of your rights. We reserve the right to enforce these restrictions, e.g. when we are obliged to retain or process certain data or have an overriding interest in doing so (as long as we are allowed to invoke these interests) or require the data for the enforcement of claims. Please note that the exercising of your rights may be in conflict with contractual obligations in certain cases and thereby may impact the fulfilment of the contract (e.g. premature termination of the contract or financial consequences). Wherever this is not already regulated in the contract, we will notify you in advance.
The exercising of your rights presupposes that you can prove your identity (e.g. with a copy of your ID card if your identity cannot be confirmed by other means). If this would incur costs for you, we will notify you in advance.
If you are the subject of the processing of personal data, you have the right to enforce your rights in a court of law or to submit a complaint with the relevant regulatory authority. The relevant authority in Switzerland is the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (http://www.edoeb.admin.ch).

## Amendments

We have the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time without notice. The current version published on our website always applies.
